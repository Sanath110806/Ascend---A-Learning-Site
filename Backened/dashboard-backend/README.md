# Backend (Reference Only)

This backend was developed using Node.js, Express, and MySQL for local testing.

Note:
- GitHub Pages does not support backend servers or databases.
- Therefore, only the frontend is deployed via GitHub Pages.
- Backend APIs were tested locally.

This folder is included for project completeness.
